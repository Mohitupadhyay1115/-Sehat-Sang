            <h1>Weight Loss</h1>
            <p>Weight loss, in the context of medicine, health, or physical fitness, refers to a reduction of the total
                body mass, by a mean loss of fluid, body fat (adipose tissue), or lean mass (namely bone mineral
                deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue). Weight loss can either occur unintentionally
                because of malnourishment or an underlying disease, or from a conscious effort to improve an actual or
                perceived overweight or obese state. "Unexplained" weight loss that is not caused by reduction in
                calorific intake or exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition.
                Intentional Intentional weight loss is the loss of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve
                fitness and health, or to change appearance through slimming. Weight loss is the main treatment for
                obesity,[1][2][3] and there is substantial evidence this can prevent progression from prediabetes to
                type 2 diabetes with a 7-10% weight loss and manage cardiometabolic health for diabetic people with a
                5-15% weight loss.[4] Weight loss in individuals who are overweight or obese can reduce health risks,[5]
                increase fitness,[6] and may delay the onset of diabetes.[5] It could reduce pain and increase movement
                in people with osteoarthritis of the knee.[6] Weight loss can lead to a reduction in hypertension (high
                blood pressure), however whether this reduces hypertension-related harm is unclear.[5][failed
                verification] Weight loss is achieved by adopting a lifestyle in which fewer calories are consumed than
                are expended.[7] Depression, stress or boredom may contribute to weight increase,[8] and in these cases,
                individuals are advised to seek medical help. A 2010 study found that dieters who got a full night's
                sleep lost more than twice as much fat as sleep-deprived dieters.[9][10] Though hypothesized that
                supplementation of vitamin D may help, studies do not support this.[11] The majority of dieters regain
                weight over the long term.[12] According to the UK National Health Service and the Dietary Guidelines
                for Americans, those who achieve and manage a healthy weight do so most successfully by being careful to
                consume just enough calories to meet their needs, and being physically active.[13][7] For weight loss to
                be permanent, changes in diet and lifestyle must be permanent as well.[14][15][16] There is evidence
                that counseling or exercise alone do not result in weight loss, whereas dieting alone results in
                meaningful long-term weight loss, and a combination of dieting and exercise provides the best
                results.[17] Meal replacements, orlistat, a very-low-calorie diet, and primary care intensive medical
                interventions can also support meaningful weight loss obesity,[1][2][3] and there is substantial evidence this can prevent progression from prediabetes to
                type 2 diabetes with a 7-10% weight loss and manage cardiometabolic health for diabetic people with a
